	Children gather what few are left around the old and tired man<br>
	Brown eyes piercing distant now with body worn and trembling hands<br>
	What was it like? What did they do? they ask of him with curious glee<br>
	Tell us all about the world of magic toys and forrests and trees!<br>
<br>
	Upon a ball of green and blue suspended in endless darkness<br>
	We carved upon an open world with stick and bone and broken promise<br>
	Metal machines built in mass to control and destroy then came to bare<br>
	Millenia of endless splendor incinerated to poisoned soil and air<br>
<br>
	Young I was when it finally fell the world my bloodline worked to save<br>
	Teaming life in ocean, sky and land now dust and endless grave<br>
	No longer blue and green but grey and black and full of haunting quiet<br>
	Few remain who know a world of simple peace, and a loving gaia<br>
<br>
	Do not weep for those now gone who each had their own hand to play<br>
	perhaps they are not forever lost but bound to be reborn one day<br>
	Upon another world like ours as blue and green and splendedly full<br>
	beings may form much like ours with hearts and minds far less cruel<br>
<br>
	Somewhere out in all that dark are endless suns which rise and set<br>
	Upon them sit the hope yet known that life can blossom without regret<br>
	So dream tonight of better things of bellies full and songs to sing<br>
	Maybe we will one day wake from this bitter fate, our cosmic catnap<br>
