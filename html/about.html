<br />
<b><i>We believe</i></b
><span class="orange"><b> progress is not an inherent virtue</b></span> and denounce innovation for its own sake absent
of the consideration for human suffering
<br />
<br />
<b><i>We believe</i></b
><span class="orange"><b> the role of government is to ensure security, prosperity and opportunity for all</b></span> by
providing the means to create and live unencumbered by the demands of economic, political, or institutional systems of
control.
<br />
<br />
<b><i>We believe</i></b> in
<span class="orange"><b>the free exchange and preservation of art, culture, and science</b></span> as only distributed
knowledge can survive fate, misfortune, nature, and time allowing us to think beyond ourselves and become people we can
admire
<br />
<br />
<b><i>We believe</i></b> math, science, and history are powerful tools which tell us
<span class="orange"
    ><b>global civilization is built from exploitation and avarice, and as such is doomed to fail</b></span
>
making it our responsibility to live humble, thoughtful, meaningful lives as the last generations to experience our age
