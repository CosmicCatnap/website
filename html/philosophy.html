<h2 class="purple center">Philosophy</h2>
<br />
<div class="center">We strive to live better by following these principles</div>
<br />
<br />

<span class="yellow"><b>Meaningful</b></span> - We strive to convey meaning through our creativity and condemn
sociopathic ideologies such as accelerationism, totalitarianism and technofudalism especially those duplicitously
disguised as righteous philosophical or political movements.
<br />
<br />
<span class="orange"><b>Compassionate</b></span> - We focus our actions toward the alleviation of suffering for all
creatures and strive to live in harmony with our ecosystem whenever possible, making all efforts to take action with
empathy, understanding, and remorse.
<br />
<br />
<span class="green"><b>Pragmatic</b></span> - We set ourselves to the task of deradicalizing and demystifying dogmatic
belief in our culture especially those which ambitiously spread grandiose narratives of history and the human condition
so that we can always be in a state of recalibration, always reconsidering and questioning our underlying assumptions
and understanding of our world.
<br />
<br />
<span class="blue"><b>Humble</b></span> - We desire not recognition or praise but only the spread of curiosity and
understanding in the hope of leaving the world better than we found it. We do not desire fortune as the accumulation of
wealth is but potential energy for charitable acts in the world or a fee for the luxury of time afforded to us only that
we might create more impactful and honest work free of influence.
<br />
<br />
<span class="red"><b>Survivalist</b></span> - We believe sustainability has become untenable and now mere survival will
be the test of our civilization. As members of the last humans to see the rich biodiversity of our world we live as
ascetic self sufficient archivists leading meager lives as counterweights to the greed responsible for our destruction.
Through this we hope to stave off the planets eternal slumber, the <i><b>cosmic catnap</b></i> awaiting it like so many
other lifeless husks across our eerily quiet galaxy.
